# CVE Replication Labs

Self-contained lab blueprints for practicing recent exploitation techniques in a
controlled environment.  Labs are designed to run locally with Docker and do
not expose vulnerable services to the public internet by default.

## Available Labs

| Lab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `outlook-ntlm-leak` | Simulates CVE-2023-23397 by crafting malicious calendar invites and capturing resulting NTLM authentication attempts. |
| `openssh-rce` | Provides an OpenSSH 9.2 server configured to demonstrate the CVE-2023-38408 `Use-after-free` condition with helper scripts. |

Use `lab_manager.py` to scaffold and interact with labs.

```bash
python lab_manager.py list
python lab_manager.py prepare outlook-ntlm-leak
python lab_manager.py destroy outlook-ntlm-leak
```

Refer to each lab's README for exploitation walkthroughs once prepared.
